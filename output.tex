% Wrapper for TikZ externalization on systems that compile with `-jobname=output`
% (e.g. Overleaf's latexmk). TikZ externalization re-runs the "real job" via
% `\input{<real job>}`; with `-jobname=output` that becomes `\input{output}`.
%
% This file makes that work by delegating to the actual main document.
